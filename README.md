## 🛠 Tecnologies

The following tools were used in building the project:

- Wordpress
- WooCommerce
- PHP and MySQL
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Gulp
- SaaSS
- Custom API


## 🚀 How to run the project

We can consider this project as being divided into 2 parts:
1. Theme "/Paralelas";
2. Plugin CUstom API "/varejo-online-integration" (By: [Petrus](https://github.com/orgs/I9ME/people/PetrovStark)).

💡*Theme works perfectly well independent of the plugin.\
💡**The Plugin plays the only role of integrating the e-commerce flow with the VarejoOnline ERP.

###Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
Git, Gulp and Node. 

Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode][vscode]

### 🎲 Running theme
```bash
# Clone este repositório
$ git@github.com:dgsoaresdev/paralelas.git

# install the dependencies
$ rum file igd2.bat

# Access project folder in terminal/cmd
$ cd paralelas

# Run the application in load preview mode
$ gulp

# The server will start on port:3000 - acess http://localhost:3000 
```
